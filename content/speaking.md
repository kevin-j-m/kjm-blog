## Anyone Can Play Guitar (With Ruby)

I've got the blues. I've been looking for the perfect guitar tone, but haven't found it. To amp up my mood, let's teach a computer to play the guitar through an amplifier.

Let's string together object-oriented principles to orchestrate a blues shuffle. We'll model our domain with the help of inheritance, composition, and dependency injection. This talk will strike a chord with you, whether you've strummed a guitar before or not.

### RubyConf Mini 2022

## Browser History Confessional

We all only have so much working memory available in our brains. Developers may joke about spending their day composing search engine queries. The reason it's a joke is because of the truth behind it. Search-driven development is a reality.

Join me, and my actual search history, on a journey to solve recent challenges I faced. I'll categorize the different types of information I often search for. You'll leave with tips on retrieving the knowledge you need for your next bug, feature, or pull request.

## Engineering MBA

Improve your work as a developer with an introduction to strategic planning,
situational leadership, and process management. No balance sheets or income
statements here; join me to learn the MBA skills valuable to developers without
the opportunity costs of lost wages or additional student loans.

Demystify the strategic frameworks your management team may use to make
decisions and learn how you can use those same concepts in your daily work.
Explore the synergy one developer achieved by going to business school (sorry,
the synergy comment slipped out - old habit).

## Enough Coverage To Beat The Band

The lights cut out. The crowd roars. It’s time. The band takes the stage.
They’ve practiced the songs, particularly the covers. They’ve sound checked the
coverage of the speakers. They know the lighting rig has the proper colored
gels covering the lamps. They’re nervous, but they’ve got it all covered.

Similarly, code coverage can give you confidence before your app performs on
production and also tell you how live code is used (or not used). We’ll cover
how to leverage ruby’s different coverage measurement techniques in concert to
assist your crew and delight your audience.

## Fake It While You Make It

We all write code to interface with external systems, like a web service or a
message queue. Can you confidently write tests without requiring the system as
a dependency? How can you shield users of your code from the inner workings of
the interface? Explore one attempt to answer these questions.

There's no shortage of tools at your disposal to solve these problems. This
talk will introduce some available options, provide guidance on when one
approach may be more appropriate than another, and discuss how to use these
tools together to ease the testing process.

## Don't Hang Me Out To DRY

Close your eyes and imagine the perfect codebase to work on. I bet you’ll say
it has complete test coverage. It’s fully-optimized, both in terms of
performance and architectural design. And, of course, it contains only DRY
code. Surely we can all agree that this is an aspirational situation.
But...do we really want that?

Don’t get me wrong; these qualities are all beneficial. However, if we also
think we should value everything in moderation, when should we push back on
these ideals? What problems can they introduce? Let’s talk about the exceptions
to some of the “rules” we all hold dear.

## I Know I Can, But Should I?

You __can__ use a hammer to drive a screw into wood, but I’d recommend a
screwdriver. Why? And when is a hammer the better option? This talk will
propose a framework to use when comparing alternative technical choices. I
won’t decide for you, but will leave you with a structure to apply in your
decision-making process.

The ruby toolbox is vast. While Rails provides a default experience, it leaves
plenty of room for alternatives. In learning how to do something, you may
uncover different ways to accomplish the same goal. Determine which tool fits
best in your situation with these lessons.

### Code and the Coding Coders who Code it

Drew Bragg and I cover prepping a talk for RailsConf, finding a job, and writing
words about code that aren't code. You can listen [here](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1927628/10596923). If you want some bonus hockey talk, you can listen to that [here](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1927628/10597043-bonus-hockey-episode).
