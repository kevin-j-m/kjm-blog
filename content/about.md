I am a full-stack Rails developer at [BookBub](https://www.bookbub.com/). My primary focus is in back-end and code design improvements. I love coaching team members to improve their technical abilities. Learning together with my coworkers is a joy. I have a [track record](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinmurphydev/) of delivering solutions to big problems with small teams.

I prefer working with back-end technologies. I'm most proficient with Ruby. I've recently written Elixir and Golang professionally. I recognize that Javascript exists, and am happy that other people like it. I enjoy solving integration and architecture concerns with projects.

I like [speaking]({{< ref "speaking" >}}) at conferences and meetups, [writing]({{< ref "featured-writing" >}}) about what I've learned, and talking on [podcasts]({{< ref "speaking#podcasts" >}}).

I graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology (2008) and Bentley University (2010). I have experience in the insurance industry, healthcare technology industry, and consulting.

I'm originally from New Hampshire. I currently live with my wife and daughter outside of Boston, Massachusetts. I support and visit my [local greyhound rescue](https://greyhoundrescuene.org/) when I can. I'm passionate about very specific musical artists, namely [Bruce Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/) and [Nine Inch Nails](https://www.nin.com/). I enjoy watching hockey and other people make woodworking projects. Unfortunately, that leaves me with no time to make projects of my own.
