Kevin Murphy is the Director of Software Development at The Gnar Company.
He works primarily with back-end technologies. He's most proficient with Ruby,
but also writes Elixir and Golang. He recognizes that Javascript exists, and is
happy that other people like it. He enjoys solving integration and architecture
concerns with projects.

Kevin graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology (2008) and
Bentley University (2010). After college, he worked as a developer in the
insurance and healthcare technology industries before joining The Gnar Company.

Kevin is originally from New Hampshire, and currently lives with his wife
and daughter outside of Boston, Massachusetts. He enjoys
supporting and visiting his [local greyhound rescue](https://greyhoundrescuene.org/)
when he can. He likes live music and is passionate about very specific artists,
namely [Bruce Springsteen](https://brucespringsteen.net/) and
[Nine Inch Nails](https://www.nin.com/). He enjoys watching hockey and other
people make woodworking projects, which leaves him with no time to make
projects of his own.

Kevin has spoken at [RailsConf 2019]({{< ref "/posts/railsconf-2019" >}}),
[RubyConf 2019]({{< ref "/posts/rubyconf-2019" >}}), [RailsConf 2020]({{< ref "/posts/railsconf-2020" >}}),

which is a test harness for the [clockwork](https://rubygems.org/gems/clockwork) gem.
