## The Ruby on Rails Podcast

I was a guest on [episode 456](https://www.therubyonrailspodcast.com/456) of The Ruby on Rails Podcast. We talked about BookBub, coverage, contributing to Ruby, and conference speaking.

I'm really thankful Brittany Martin asked me to come on. It's a big honor for me to have appeared on the show.
