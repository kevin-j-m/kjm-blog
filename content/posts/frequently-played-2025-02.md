## Frequently Played

I tend to listen to the same songs or albums on repeat that are evocative of how I'm feeling or what's going on with me. Here is what I'm currently listening to over, and over, and over, and over, again.

## Valentine's Day

'Tis the season. I listen to the Tunnel of Love album throughout February every
year.

> So hold me close, honey, say you're forever mine  
> And tell me you'll be my lonely valentine

It's interesting what people say they can endure for others. Even the wind.

[Full Lyrics](https://genius.com/Brian-fallon-i-dont-mind-if-im-with-you-lyrics)

> Never had a good friend, no one like you  
> But I spent a lotta time on my own  
> And they set me on fire and I did a lot of burning  
> They told me I didn't know things I thought I knew for certain  
> But I, I don't mind  
> And now the wind's getting colder and the night's getting cruel  
> But I don't mind, I don't mind if I'm with you  
> ...  
> You've been a light in the hallway in the dark of my room  
> Do you feel any better now?
