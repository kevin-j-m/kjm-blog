## Frequently Played

I tend to listen to the same songs or albums on repeat that are evocative of how I'm feeling or what's going on with me. Here is what I'm currently listening to over, and over, and over, and over, again.

These riffs are super fun to play. My maybe toxic 90's music take is that Jimmy Chamberlin is the best drummer of the bunch. Sorry Danny Carey, Josh Freese, and others.

> That I was on a sinkin' ship  
> I never let on that I was down  
> You blame yourself  
> For what you can't ignore  
> You blame yourself for wanting more

Rather than the [original](https://youtu.be/P9BfvPjsXXw?si=9-RpGTapuM2PIJiV), I've specifically been listening to the version from Allie Goertz's [Peeled Back](https://alliegoertz.bandcamp.com/album/peeled-back) album of Nine Inch Nails covers. The album strikes me as full of earnest representations of the songs, rather than pandering or playing for a cheeky response.

> We have to hold on  
> All that we were is gone
