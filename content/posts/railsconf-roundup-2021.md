# RailsConf 2021

[RailsConf](https://railsconf.com/) wrapped up in mid-April with a virtual
gathering, featuring attendees from 61 different countries. The talks are now
available to all on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/rubycentral/videos), so
if you're looking for some suggestions on where to start, please allow me to
curate a list for you.

## Recommended Talks

### Refactoring: A developer's guide to writing well

This is my favorite session that I've had the opportunity to watch thus far.
Writing is such a critical component of our jobs (and lives), and this primer is
presented in such a friendly manner.

### Hiring is Not Hazing

If you're associated with a tech company, and reading this around the time that
this published - you're probably hiring. Whether you are or not, take this
opportunity to evaluate the process you use to lead to better outcomes for
candidates and the organization.

### Missing Guide to Service Objects in Rails

"Service objects" as a concept means so many different things to different
people. This talk introduces different philosophies people take in constructing
service objects and presents the trade-offs of each.

### A Day in the Life of a Ruby Object

Garbage collection, mark and sweep, page size, memory allocation - all concepts
that can feel very intimidating. However, when presented so masterfully
eloquently, this talk is a great way to make these topics feel more
approachable.

### Engineering MBA: Be The Boss of Your Own Work

I'll be honest: I did not actually watch this talk. But let's just say I'm
**very** familiar with the subject matter and the presentation.

## Talks I Look Forward To

I did not have the opportunity to watch everything I wanted to during the
conference. Here is a small sampling of what's still on my list.

### The History of Making Mistakes

As someone that has _certainly_ never made a mistake before, I can't wait to
learn what all the fuss is about.

### How Reference Librarians Can Help Us Help Each Other

Anything that talks about how awesome librarians are is ok by me. I look forward
to hearing more about how I can approach my day-to-day work with the mindset and
tools that a reference librarian brings to bear in their profession.

### What the fork()?

Need something to be faster? We'll fork a process and it'll magically be better,
because concurrency...right? I'll let you know after I give this talk a view.
