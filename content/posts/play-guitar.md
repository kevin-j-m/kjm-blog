I'm delighted to be [speaking](https://twitter.com/RubyConfMini/status/1573031880022032385) at [RubyConf Mini](https://www.rubyconfmini.com/) this November in Providence, RI. I hope you'll consider joining us.

## Abstract

I've got the blues. I've been looking for the perfect guitar tone, but haven't found it. To amp up my mood, let's teach a computer to play the guitar through an amplifier.

Let's string together object-oriented principles to orchestrate a blues shuffle. We'll model our domain with the help of inheritance, composition, and dependency injection. This talk will strike a chord with you, whether you've strummed a guitar before or not.
