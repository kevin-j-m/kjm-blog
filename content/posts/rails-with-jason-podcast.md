Jason Swett was kind enough to him me on his podcast, [Rails With Jason](https://www.codewithjason.com/rails-with-jason-podcast/). We discussed the contents of my RailsConf 2021 talk: Engineering MBA.

Thanks for having me on Jason! You can give it a listen [here](https://www.codewithjason.com/rails-with-jason-podcast/episodes/096-engineering-mba-with-kevin-murphy-jumSoete/).
