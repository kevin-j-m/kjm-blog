## Frequently Played

> And I learned about the blues from this kitten that I knew  
> Her hair was raven and her heart was like a tomb  
> My heart is like a wound  
> And I saw taillights last night in a dream about my first wife  
> Everybody leaves and I'd expect as much from you  
> I saw taillights last night in a dream about my old life  
> Everybody leaves, Mary why, why wouldn't you?  

## Isn't Everyone

> We've all surrendered to those we serve  
> We get the world we all deserve
