## Frequently Played

I tend to listen to the same songs or albums on repeat that are evocative of how I'm feeling or what's going on with me. Here is what I'm currently listening to over, and over, and over, and over, again.

I pre-ordered the new The Last Dinner Party album right away. Yes, I buy music.

[Full Lyrics](https://genius.com/The-last-dinner-party-this-is-the-killer-speaking-lyrics)

> If only you’d been honest, could have spared this bloodshed  
> Now I’m wanted ‘cross several county lines  
> When your hand is bigger than my heart  
> You can crush it, just the way I like  
> You got a whole lotta’ nerve and a whole lotta’ spite  
> When you leave, don’t look me in the eye

I'm very much looking forward to stepping out of the world for a few hours and
seeing them live again at the end of the month. And back with my favorite

> Always going to go this way, there's no turning back  
> Never any other way, there's no turning back  
> Everything for a reason, everything for a reason  
> Everything for a reason, everything for a reason
