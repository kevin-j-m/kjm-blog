> And we want love like it was a drug  
> Yeah, all we wanted was a little relief  
> And every heart I held in between  
> Well, they were painkillers to me  
> Yeah, they were painkillers to me  
> Come get your painkillers from me

I often debate myself about the most underrated Springsteen song. This comes up often.

[Full Lyrics](https://genius.com/Bruce-springsteen-downbound-train-lyrics)

> Last night, I heard your voice  
> You were crying, crying, you were so alone  
> You said your love had never died  
> You were waiting for me at home
