## Frequently Played

I tend to listen to the same songs or albums on repeat that are evocative of how I'm feeling or what's going on with me. Here is what I'm currently listening to over, and over, and over, and over, again.

## Buckle

Just get the new album. And all the prior albums. You're welcome.

> I'm much too old for this  
> But I'm not over it  
>  
> 'Cause I'm stupid and I'm damaged and you're a disaster  
> When you walk into the room, oh, none of it matters  
> Oh, baby, I just buckle my resolution in tatters  
> 'Cause I know it won't work, but make it ache, make it hurt  
> I'm not better than this, show me what I'm worth  
>  
> Keep me a secret, choose someone else  
> I'll still be here hanging off, I'm hanging off  
> The buckle on your belt

Yup, Brian Fallon again. I don't have very varied musical tastes.

> And we want love like it was a drug  
> Yeah, all we wanted was a little relief  
> And every heart I held in between  
> Well, they were painkillers to me  
> Yeah, they were painkillers to me  
> Come get your painkillers from me
