## Frequently Played

I tend to listen to the same songs or albums on repeat that are evocative of how I'm feeling or what's going on with me. Here is what I'm currently listening to over, and over, and over, and over, again.

## Racing In The Street

This musical outro is transcendent.

> She sits on the porch of her daddy's house  
> But all her pretty dreams are torn  
> She stares off alone into the night  
> With the eyes of one who hates for just being born

I'm not super familiar with Slipknot, but I know others are. Jim Root seems
like a really cool, down-to-Earth guitar playing person. At the time of this
performance, that's Jay Weinberg playing drums, son of Max, the drummer of the E
Street Band. Jay has filled in for Max on E Street dates in the past.

> You ran away, you're all the same  
> Angels lie to keep control  
> My love was punished long ago
