## RubyConf 2022 Videos Released

RubyCentral has released the videos from RubyConf and RubyConf Mini 2022 on
their YouTube page. That includes my talk, ["Anyone Can Play Guitar (With Ruby)"](https://youtu.be/t0C75Z0LX20).

My slides, proposal, code examples, and related blog posts are [available to accompany the talk]({{< ref "/play-guitar" >}}).

If you're curious for other talks to check out, you can see my [RubyConf Mini recap]({{< ref "rubyconf-mini-2022-recap" >}}) for some ideas.
