## Frequently Played

I tend to listen to the same songs or albums on repeat that are evocative of how I'm feeling or what's going on with me. Here is what I'm currently listening to over, and over, and over, and over, again.

## Downbound Train

I often debate myself about the most underrated Springsteen song. This comes up often.

[Full Lyrics](https://genius.com/Bruce-springsteen-downbound-train-lyrics)

> Last night, I heard your voice  
> You were crying, crying, you were so alone  
> You said your love had never died  
> You were waiting for me at home  

## Yvette Young

Yvette is the guitarist in Covet and has solo stuff too. I've mostly been enjoying
her interviews. Her playing style is phenomenal, and I'm intrigued by how
she approaches the instrument. I like hearing the way she explains concepts and
describes how she makes the choices she does.
