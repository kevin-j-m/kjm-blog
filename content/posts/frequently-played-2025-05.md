## Frequently Played

> All the words that never came out right  
> Within reach, but out of sight  
> All the songs that couldn't mend your heart  
> But slit it up and tore apart

> In the middle of thе night, it feeds  
> In the middle of the night, it еats you  
> Everybody knows  
> Everywhere I go  
> I can never run and I cannot hide  
>  
> I'm done crying  
> Over someone like you  
> I'm done crying  
> Hope you're feeling it too now  
> I'm done
