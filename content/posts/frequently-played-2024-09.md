## Frequently Played

I tend to listen to the same songs or albums on repeat that are evocative of how I'm feeling or what's going on with me. Here is what I'm currently listening to over, and over, and over, and over, again.

## The Blues, Mary

Brian Fallon may be best known as the lead singer of The Gaslight Anthem. I appreciate his solo work during their hiatus too. I think future entries of this series will feature a lot of Brian's output.

> I learned how to cry  
> In them lonesome September nights  
> I learned to get by  
> With the dogs and the dirt and the charm of the street  
> I fell asleep most nights  
> With your pictures right behind my eyes, your eyes  
> ...  
> And cause your smile  
> Is bright like the ramparts on the 4th of July  
> And my baby swings like a boxer  
> And sends her right hooks under my chin  
> She cries like a baby  
> And she wears me just like a ring  
> Cries like a baby  
> And she wears me just like a ring  
> I'd rather go than watch you leave  

## And All That Could Have Been

This is my favorite Nine Inch Nails song. However, I can only listen to it when I'm in a certain mood. And when I do listen to it, it's on repeat.

> Please  
> Take this  
> And run far away  
> Far as you can see  
> I am tainted  
> And happiness  
> And peace of mind  
> Were never meant for me  
> All these pieces  
> And promises  
> And left-behinds  
> If only I could see  
> In my nothing  
> You meant everything  
> Everything to me
