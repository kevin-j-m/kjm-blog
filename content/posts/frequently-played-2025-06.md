> And we want love like it was a drug  
> Yeah, all we wanted was a little relief  
> And every heart I held in between  
> Well, they were painkillers to me  
> Yeah, they were painkillers to me  
> Come get your painkillers from me

> It's a fairy tale so tragic  
> There's no prince to break the spell  
> I don't believe in magic  
> But for you, I will, yeah, for you, I will  
> If I'm a fool, I'll be a fool  
> Darling, for you
