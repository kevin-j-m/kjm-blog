## Frequently Played

I tend to listen to the same songs or albums on repeat that are evocative of how I'm feeling or what's going on with me. Here is what I'm currently listening to over, and over, and over, and over, again.

Unfortunately, miracles are nothing more than [dreams gone bad]( {{<ref "frequently-played-2024-12/#the-river">}} ).

[Full Lyrics](https://genius.com/Bruce-springsteen-countin-on-a-miracle-lyrics)

> It's a fairy tale so tragic  
> There's no prince to break the spell  
> I don't believe in magic  
> But for you, I will, yeah, for you, I will  
> If I'm a fool, I'll be a fool  
> Darling, for you

The Struts are maybe the greatest expression of pure joy and excitement I've
seen live. If Rock N Roll still mattered culturally, they'd be a household name.

> I wanna live better days  
> Never look back and say  
> Could have been me  
> It could have been me  

## Yvette Young

Yvette is the guitarist in Covet and has solo stuff too. I've mostly been enjoying
her interviews. Her playing style is phenomenal, and I'm intrigued by how
she approaches the instrument. I like hearing the way she explains concepts and
describes how she makes the choices she does.
