> And who are you supposed to be?  
> You look like heaven tonight  
> Me, I'm a tomb, a corpse in a suit  
> Trying to look a little alive  
> Are you alright?  
> 'Cause I worry sometimes  
> Are you dressed up to take my life?

Certainly not their strongest effort.

Coincidentally, the E Street Band starts the Canadian swing of their tour tonight. I'd definitely run away to Canada and catch a show if I could.

> This is terrible!
