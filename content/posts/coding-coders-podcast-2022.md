I am the latest guest on the Code and the Coding Coders who Code it [podcast](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1927628).

Drew Bragg and I cover prepping a talk for RailsConf, finding a job, and writing
words about code that aren't code. You can listen [here](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1927628/10596923).

Drew and I stuck around unexpectedly to discuss our shared love of hockey, that
you can hear [here](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1927628/10597043-bonus-hockey-episode).
