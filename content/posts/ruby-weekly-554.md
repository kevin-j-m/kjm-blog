I'm excited to be in this week's Ruby Weekly, [#554](https://rubyweekly.com/issues/554).

{{< figure src="/img/ruby_weekly_554.png" class="mid" >}}

The article they included is a [post]({{< ref "activerecord-new-block" >}})
from my employer's [blog](https://blog.thegnar.co/activerecord-new-block)
about passing a block to ActiveRecord methods, and how it differs from using
`tap`.
