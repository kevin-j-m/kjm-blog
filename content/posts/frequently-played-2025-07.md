## Frequently Played

I tend to listen to the same songs or albums on repeat that are evocative of how I'm feeling or what's going on with me. Here is what I'm currently listening to over, and over, and over, and over, again.

## Painkillers

Yup, Brian Fallon again. I don't have very varied musical tastes.

> And we want love like it was a drug  
> Yeah, all we wanted was a little relief  
> And every heart I held in between  
> Well, they were painkillers to me  
> Yeah, they were painkillers to me  
> Come get your painkillers from me

## Good Time

I'm missing them on tour with Gaslight Anthem this cycle.

> So he rushes in to tell you what he did today  
> But he can’t think of what to say  
> I think you listen anyway  
> 
> He wants to have a good time just like everybody  
> He doesn’t want to fall apart  
> 
> You watch him as he stutters over what to say  
> It's just a little game you play  
> It's no easier for you some days  
> You wish that you could tell him it’ll be okay  
> But you feel a little shy these days  
> 'Cause everybody goes away

The lyrical content is not a driving factor here, but we do have another data
point to prove that Halsey rips.
