My daughter got me a new guitar stand I have set up in the living room. This lets me *see* my guitars more easily, which I enjoy. Inspired by that, I wanted to make my own stand to support two guitars in the office area of my bedroom.

## Build

I used a piece of hickory wood that's been waiting to be put to good use for this project. Armed with an idea of the visual look I wanted, I drew the shape I wanted to end up with. I used my pull saw to make the initial cuts, with the hickory secured in a vice.

With my vertical lines cut, I need to connect them horizontally. I drilled a hole with a forstner bit in the corners with a wide enough diameter to use a jigsaw to connect the lines.

I cleaned up those surfaces with sandpaper wrapping a wood block smaller than the cavities I created. They were too small for my orbital sander to reach in.

With this I had my side structures built. But I needed two sides, and this was one block of wood. I cut the structure in half for two equal sides. I used my tablesaw for this.

To connect the sides together, I cut 1 inch square stretchers for the front and back. I cut dados in the sides of the same width as the stretchers. I attached the sides to the stretchers with wood glue, the stretchers nestled in the dado joints.

I took no pictures of this of course.

## Finish

With that dry, I attached rubber pads along all the areas a guitar might touch. I also put some on the bottom for feet. I finished with polycrylic, because that's what I have hanging around.

You can see I built a single-guitar prototype out of cheaper scrap wood. That is less sturdy because there's not the heft to hold a guitar, so it's very prone to falling over. The prototype served its purpose in the development phase though. And it works now as a secondary low-profile stand I can use as long as I have a place where the neck of the guitar can rest.

## Display

I enjoyed building this project and it's been working as intended.

I did need to make some adjustments to the front stand. It was too deep to accommodate some guitars. The knob layouts would hit against the cavity that holds them. I cut down the depth by chopping off some of the top and now we're in business.

You may recognize the guitars if you read my last post. I recently [did some work]({{< ref "installing-guitar-pick-me-ups/" >}}) on them.
