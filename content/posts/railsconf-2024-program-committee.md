## RailsConf 2024 Program

I'm thrilled to be part of the RailsConf 2024 [Program Committee](https://railsconf.org/about/). [RailsConf](https://railsconf.org/) is taking place in Detroit, MI from May 7-9. We'll have two days of talks with a hack day/community day in between.

To put together a great program, we need __your help__. I hope you'll consider submitting a talk proposal to our [CFP](https://sessionize.com/railsconf2024/), which is open until February 13. I want to read your proposal!

Thank you to Ufuk Kayserilioglu and Andy Croll for inviting me to participate. Special thanks to past Program Committee members for answering my questions.

Whether as a speaker or an attendee, I hope I'll see you in Detroit this May.
