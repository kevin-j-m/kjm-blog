## Glitch on Plaster

I recently received some new prints that immediately went into frames and made their way on to my wall. They're all from [Rob Sheridan](https://rob-sheridan.com/). I first learned about Rob from his time as the Creative Director of Nine Inch
Nails, and I've enjoyed following his work since then.

These are all poorly-taken phone camera pictures of high-quality prints from within frames. Trust that the quality of images you see in front of you do not do justice to their true representation.

## Precipice (second edition)

{{< figure src="/img/2025_09_10_precipice.jpg" class="mid" alt="A print of Rob Sheridan's 'Precipice' in a frame" >}}

Rob provides some context about this piece:

> The allure and fear of the unknown; the double-edged sword of feeling like anything is possible, for better or worse. The warm glow of possibility corrupted by an ominous existential dread that the ground beneath us is eroding, and the light on the horizon is cracking apart; that we stand on a fragile precipice where hope and fear are intertwined; the more love you have, the more you have to lose.

As you might be able to tell, I'm drawn to Rob's centering of an individual in disparate environments around them. I see the glitch around the figure here as both a prison and a protective layer between them and the outside world. Which it's acting as at the moment depends on your perspective and frame of mind.

I have print 42/55; you should [get yours](https://robsheridan.storenvy.com/collections/1829473-latest-additions/products/36906567-precipice-small-giclee-print-8-x-10-second-edition).

## Reach (remastered vertical edition)

{{< figure src="/img/2025_09_10_reach.jpg" class="mid" alt="A print of Rob Sheridan's 'Reach' in a frame" >}}

I spend the majority of my daily life attempting to provide instructions to a computer. Navigating a literal digital sea. We spend untold amounts of time wading in artifices meant to evoke experiences similar to, but not quite matching, the physical world.

It can take so much energy and effort to pull yourself up from those depths. To seek connection. You can succeed in extending yourself to meet the world only to find...no one is there.

I have print 11/25; you should [get yours](https://robsheridan.storenvy.com/collections/1829473-latest-additions/products/36716500-reach-small-giclee-print-8-x-10-remastered-vertical-edition).

## Turbulence

{{< figure src="/img/2025_09_10_turbulence.jpg" class="mid" alt="A print of Rob Sheridan's 'Turbulence' in a frame" >}}
Rob succinctly introduces this as:

> A new glitch piece about surviving, rising above, holding on to yourself when it feels like you’re coming apart.

This is the image that evokes the most visceral reaction in me. Unfortunately, I find myself struggling to explain it accurately. Something about the degradations of the repeating figure really gets me. The color palette feels both ominous while still warm and inviting. Like I belong there, but I don't know if I want to be there.

## Bonus

Rob and Steph were kind enough to include a sticker with a personalized note. Whether or not any of these pieces speak to you, I suggest checking out the rest of Rob's [store](https://robsheridan.storenvy.com/) and [work](https://rob-sheridan.com/).

{{< figure src="/img/2025_09_10_sticker_back.jpg" class="mid" alt="The back of the sticker, where Rob wrote, 'Thanks Kevin! -Rob'" >}}

Thank *you*, Rob.

## Nothing Studios 2000

With the 25th anniversary of [Things Falling Apart](https://www.patreon.com/posts/144077283), Rob pulled some rare prints out, and I got a matching set. These photos are important to me because of their setting (Nothing Studios) and time (2000) they were taken.

{{< figure src="/img/2025_12_21_texture_set.jpg" class="mid" alt="Both texture prints in frames mounted on the wall. In the reflection you can see artwork from the opposite walls." >}}

## texture: studio I

{{< figure src="/img/2025_12_21_texture_studio_i.jpg" class="mid" alt="A print of Rob Sheridan's texture: studio i. A close-up of synthesizer keys taken with a macro lens. Signed by Rob and labeled 62/65." >}}

> Personal photography taken on 35mm film of the textures of Nothing Studios, New Orleans, where I was living in the year 2000, at the beginning of my journey with macro lenses. Macro photography opened up new portals of expression all around me; emotions from the inanimate, stories from mundane details. It inspired my artwork for Nine Inch Nails' "Things Falling Apart" that same year, and the process of exploring details of instruments and the texture of the studio environment would lay the groundwork for my photography on Nine Inch Nails' "Ghosts I-IV" in 2008.

Unfortunately, this got bent in transit. I'll chalk it up to a real-world glitch.

I have print 62/65.

## texture: studio II
