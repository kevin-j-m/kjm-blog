## Abstract

RailsConf has played an important role in my professional and personal life. I've learned about technology in ways I wouldn't have otherwise at RailsConf. I've learned about myself in ways I wouldn't have otherwise thanks to RailsConf. I've met people that changed the course of my career thanks to RailsConf. I've met others who have become dear friends thanks to RailsConf. I've done things I've never done before thanks to RailsConf.

The same may be true for you. We should celebrate and reflect on that. Where do we go from here? Let's talk about it together.
