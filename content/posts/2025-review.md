This isn't a "real" post. This is a summary of all the things that made up my year in 2025 (almost all in a professional context). Thanks to all who were a part of it.

## Writing

I published 8 articles about Ruby or software development in general this year. The first was about [it]({{< ref "what-is-it-in-ruby-34" >}}). My last post of the year was a highly-nuanced take on [reviewing AI PRs]({{< ref "how-to-review-ai-generated-prs" >}}).

In between, I wrote about [REST]({{< ref "dont-rest-on-your-laurels" >}}), [flash messages]({{< ref "preserving-flash-messages-in-rails" >}}), and more.

I continue sending my posts to [newsletter subscribers](https://newsletter.kevinjmurphy.com/). You can still subscribe via [RSS](https://kevinjmurphy.com/index.xml) or try to keep up wherever I post on [social media]({{< ref "/about#elsewhere-on-the-internet" >}}).

My most-read posts are those that end up in [other newsletters]({{< ref "featured-writing" >}}). This year, my writing appeared in [Ruby Weekly](https://rubyweekly.com/) 6 times and [Short Ruby Newsletter](https://newsletter.shortruby.com/) 6 times.

I kept with my plan to publish a "real post" every other month. Eventually that'll turn into "whenever I want or have something to say". This is the first full year I also shared what [songs]({{< ref "/tags/music/" >}}) I was stuck on each month.

## Speaking

I did submit to one CFP this year and was accepted. It was important to me to [be at]({{< ref "railsconf-2025-recap" >}}) and [speak at]({{< ref "ten-years-of-railsconf" >}}) the final RailsConf. I came into the event with many complicated feelings. Those feelings have only become more difficult to tease out with what's happened in the community since then.

As with the past few years, I was a coach for the RubyCentral CFP coaching sessions for RailsConf. I helped friends prepare their proposals and talks when asked.

No podcasts this year.

If you have an event you'd like me to speak at, or a podcast you'd like me to guest on, let me know.

## Employer

I've been at [Pubmark](https://www.pubmark.com/) all year. I enjoy the work that I do, and the people I do it with. There have been some shifts and changes, but I've been trying to stay in my comfort zone. It's been helpful for my personal life.

## New (to me) in 2025

Here's where I take a break to step out of work and talk about things (mostly music) I got into this year.

### The Last Dinner Party

I caught on to them earlier this year and was treated with a new album later in the year. I'm looking forward to seeing them live in 2026.

### Light from Uncommon Stars

I think this was the [book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_from_Uncommon_Stars) I enjoyed the most this year, but it's close between that and [Beautyland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beautyland).

### Yvette Young

I heard about Yvette from the NAMM coverage of this year, which included her signature guitar pedal, the [Qi Etherealizer](https://yvetteyoungmusic.com/products/signed-qi-etherealizer-pedal-by-walrus-audio). From there, I dug into a bunch of interviews she's done, and obviously her music. Her technical proficiency is matched by her ability to evoke emotion through music. I also really appreciate how she explains her approach and reasons she makes the choices she does.

## Thank You

Thanks for reading, watching, or listening. It's been a rough year for the world it seems. I hope you find happy and joy, no matter how fleeting it is.
