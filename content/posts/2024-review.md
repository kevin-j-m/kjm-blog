This isn't a "real" post. This is a summary of all the things that made up my year in 2024 (almost all in a professional context). Thanks to all who were a part of it.

## Writing

I published 7 articles about Ruby or software development in general this year. The first was about possible [RailsConf tracks]({{< ref "tracks-not-at-railsconf-2024" >}}). My last post of the year covered what I saw at [RubyConf]({{< ref "rubyconf-2024-recap" >}}).

In between conference posts, I wrote about [Sidekiq batches]({{< ref "making-a-sidekiq-batch-recipe" >}}), accessing [request headers]({{< ref "access-request-headers-in-rails-controller" >}}) in Rails, and [RSpec stubbing]({{< ref "rspec-stubs-object-in-memory" >}}).

I continue sending my posts to [newsletter subscribers](https://newsletter.kevinjmurphy.com/). You can still subscribe via [RSS](https://kevinjmurphy.com/index.xml) or try to keep up wherever I post on [social media]({{< ref "/about#elsewhere-on-the-internet" >}}).

My most-read posts are those that end up in [other newsletters]({{< ref "featured-writing" >}}). This year, my writing appeared in [Ruby Weekly](https://rubyweekly.com/) 8 times, [Short Ruby Newsletter](https://newsletter.shortruby.com/) 6 times, [TL;DR Web Dev](https://a.tldrnewsletter.com/web-version?ep=1&lc=370b268c-04a2-11ef-ae94-154a86672d19&p=d99d0dce-174a-11ef-8688-c9b4f033c41d&pt=campaign&t=1716289633&s=f8d64a684b167de86dcb877ce42b9aa5b55fba7f1cbe8c8d40a248c4b598149c) once, and [Ruby Central's monthly newsletter](https://rubycentral.org/news/may-2024-newsletter/) once.

I cut down my publishing schedule again. Intentionally. I started the year saying I was going to [slow down]({{< ref "slowing-down" >}}) and then immediately joined the [RailsConf Programming Committee]({{< ref "railsconf-2024-program-committee" >}}). Whoops. But also worth it.

I'll continue to have a lighter content calendar indefinitely. It may quickly turn into a "post whenever I want" situation, rather than the current every other month.

## Speaking

I did submit to one CFP this year, but was not accepted. Speaking was not a priority for me this year.

I helped conference speakers more this year. I was a coach for the RubyCentral CFP coaching sessions for RailsConf. I was a speaker mentor at RailsConf. I helped friends prepare their proposals and talks when asked.

As mentioned in the writing section, I was also on the [RailsConf Programming Committee]({{< ref "railsconf-2024-program-committee" >}}). That was a new experience for me. It was an honor to be asked and to help bring the conference together. I hope everyone that attended enjoyed it.

On the podcasting front, I was a guest on one episode of [Ruby for All]({{< ref "ruby-for-all-guest-2024" >}}) to speak about RailsConf.

If you have an event you'd like me to speak at, or a podcast you'd like me to guest on, let me know.

## Employer

I've been at [Pubmark](https://www.pubmark.com/) all year. I enjoy the work that I do, and the people I do it with. There have been some shifts and changes, but I've been trying to stay in my comfort zone. It's been helpful for my personal life.

## New (to me) in 2024

Here's where I take a break to step out of work and talk about things (mostly music) I got into this year.

### NF - The Search

I was introduced to this artist this year and I'm thankful for it.

### Front Desk

A quick [book](https://frontdeskthebook.com/), but the most enjoyable reading experience I had this year.

### Metallica (Live)

I've been PRETTY AWARE of them, but somehow I've avoided seeing Metallica live. This changed over the summer when I saw them twice. This video is from one of the shows I attended.

### Magic and Illusion

I'm not learning it myself, but I witnessed some ✨[magic](https://www.nowherebookshop.com/book/9781250119889)✨ this year.

And I'm left wondering what's real and what was an illusion.
