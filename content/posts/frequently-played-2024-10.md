## Frequently Played

I tend to listen to the same songs or albums on repeat that are evocative of how I'm feeling or what's going on with me. Here is what I'm currently listening to over, and over, and over, and over, again.

In my experience, it takes more than 21 days.

> I miss you most  
> In the morning  
> We used to talk  
> Over coffee  
> But now  
> I'm gonna have to find  
> Another friend  
> When it's over  
> We do the leaving  
> We do the crying  
> We do the healing  
> And they say  
> 21 days till I don't miss you

Another entry that's Brian Fallon and NIN. I guess that's just where I'm at these days.

> I got my heart, but my heart's no good  
> And you're the only one that's understood  
> ...  
> Without you  
> Without you everything falls apart  
> Without you  
> It's not as much fun to pick up the pieces
