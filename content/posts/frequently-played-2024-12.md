## The River

Bruce is my favorite storyteller. He speaks to me. Helps me understand stories beyond my own, while also making sense of things in my life.

> Now those memories come back to haunt me  
> They haunt me like a curse  
> Is a dream a lie if it don't come true?  
> Or is it something worse?

This blog isn't the first time The Gaslight Anthem and Bruce Springsteen [got together](https://youtu.be/y1atupgwaew?si=imMgLS60Q17Qatje). Not the latest [official time](https://youtu.be/CjhVOCQqUPs?si=YnEtVxzRE8X3udsC) either.

[Full Lyrics](https://genius.com/The-gaslight-anthem-get-hurt-lyrics)

> Have you come to take her away from me?  
> From me, from me  
> Might as well do your worst to me  
> And maybe you needed a change or maybe I was in the way  
> Maybe some things they stay and some things go away
