I'm honored to be speaking as part of RailsConf 2021, which you can join from
[wherever](http://railsconf.com/) you are. I hope you'll join [my session](https://railsconf.com/program/sessions#session-1136)
and many others from April 13 - 15, 2021.

## Abstract

Improve your work as a developer with an introduction to strategic planning,
situational leadership, and process management. No balance sheets or income
statements here; join me to learn the MBA skills valuable to developers without
the opportunity costs of lost wages or additional student loans.

Demystify the strategic frameworks your management team may use to make
decisions and learn how you can use those same concepts in your daily work.
Explore the synergy one developer achieved by going to business school (sorry,
the synergy comment slipped out - old habit).
