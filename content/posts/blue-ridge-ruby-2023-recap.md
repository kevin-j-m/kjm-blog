## Blue Ridge Ruby 2023

Blue Ridge Ruby recently wrapped up in Asheville, North Carolina. This post is not intended as a review of any of the talks, but to highlight the variety of great work from all involved. I hope you'll seek out the full videos of all the sessions that interest you once they are available.

## Day 1

### Welcome

Jeremy Smith gave an intro that I hope to see expanded into a full conference talk one day. Maybe after he's not so busy organizing a conference.

### Enough Coverage To Beat The Band

[I](https://blueridgeruby.com/speakers/kevin-murphy/) had the pleasure to bring the "Ruby's Got You Covered" [world tour]({{< ref "coverage" >}}) to Asheville. This was my first time sharing this with an in-person audience.

### Empathetic Pair Programming with Nonviolent Communication

[Stephanie Minn](https://blueridgeruby.com/speakers/stephanie-minn/) shared a way we can reframe our mindsets and statements in pairing situations and beyond. We reviewed observations, feelings, needs, and requests within the NVC (Nonviolent Communication) framework.

### Forecasting the Future: An Introduction to Machine Learning for Weather Prediction in Native Ruby

[Landon Gray](https://blueridgeruby.com/speakers/landon-gray/) gave us an appreciation for all the work that goes in to prepare, manipulate, and clean the training data used in machine learning models.

### Who Wants To Be A Ruby Engineer?

Drew Bragg, to the surprise of everyone only paying attention to the schedule on the website, hosted a small version of his popular game show after lunch.

### RSpec: The Bad Parts

[Caleb Hearth](https://blueridgeruby.com/speakers/caleb-hearth/) demonstrated how we can use test structures that promote obviousness. Test examples should show what's being tested and how it is being used.

### Maintenance Matters: Maintaining Your Rails App and Your Sanity

[Annie Kiley](https://blueridgeruby.com/speakers/annie-kiley/) shared 10 suggestions to keep maintenance at the forefront of your application development process. I liked their ethos to make it easier to do the better thing, and that standards are not standards unless they're enforced.

### Making Ruby Fast(er)

[Kevin Menard](https://blueridgeruby.com/speakers/kevin-menard/) ended the day of talks, just as a different Kevin started them. This talk starts with a discussion on Instruction Set Architectures (ISA) on silicon and transitions to YARV optimizations of Ruby code on a virtual machine (VM). Interpreters, parsers, and compilers - oh my!

## Day 2

### What’s your type? Generating type signatures with Sorbet and Tapioca

[Emily Samp](https://blueridgeruby.com/speakers/emily-samp/) reflected on her reflection experience. Through this we learned how Tapioca generates RBI files for Sorbet to use. Give this one a watch for her beautiful slide design and expert animations and transitions.

### Digital Identity or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Web3

[Thomas Carr](https://blueridgeruby.com/speakers/thomas-carr/) discussed the concept of a self-sovereign identity. This enables a user to manage their own data.

### Go Pro with POROs

[Ifat Ribon](https://blueridgeruby.com/speakers/ifat-ribon/) discussed encapsulation, clarity and simplicity. Starting with a primer on database wrappers and modules, we moved into exploring different patterns where Plain Old Ruby Objects (POROs) apply: services, API wrappers, virtual domain models, and request/presentation objects.

### Lightning Talks

Fishing, stewardship, CLI tools for generating licenses and CI results, Rails tips, hiring, 1:1s with managers, and accessibility were just a few of the topics covered in these five minute sessions.

### How can I move forward when I don’t know where I want to go?

[Mo O’Connor](https://blueridgeruby.com/speakers/mo-oconnor/) introduced tools to guide decisions on moving forward. Individual Development Plans, applying/interviewing, somatics, pros/cons lists, mentorship, and building relationships were the topics covered.

Thank you to the sponsors for supporting a fledgling event. Particular thanks to Pubmark for helping support my participation.

Thank you to everyone who I met there. A conference doesn't work unless people show up, and you all made it the event it became. Thanks to everyone for the kind words about my talk. I really appreciate it. Speaking is a lot of work - hearing from people afterwards is what makes it worth it.

Congrats Jeremy; you did it.
