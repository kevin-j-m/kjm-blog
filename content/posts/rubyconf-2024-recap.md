## RubyConf 2024

RubyConf recently wrapped up in Chicago, Illinois. This post is meant to highlight the great work from all involved. I documented my updates from "on the ground" [elsewhere]({{< ref "at_rubyconf2024" >}}). I hope you'll seek out the full videos of all the sessions that interest you once they are available. Unfortunately, I couldn't be everywhere, so this covers what I saw. I certainly did not come anywhere close to doing all the things I planned.

## Day 1

### Opening Keynote

Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto started the conference after the opening remarks. He reviewed some key features introduced in Ruby throughout the years. Ruby was originally created for a developer with the following interests:

* Loves programming
* Loves freedom
* Wants to be productive

### Names from a hat

Murray Steele sampled different approaches to retrieving subsets of data. With the goal of fun and whimsy, you can be open to safely explore new tools or paradigms.

### Compose Software Like Nature Would

Ahmed Omran used metaphors from the world around us to inform how we can design our software systems.

### Coordinate Ruby Teams

Noel Rappin and Brandt Sheets from the I Heart Ruby team at Chime shared tooling they've built to share standards and progress across teams.

### The State of RubyGems

Samuel Giddins, Martin Emde, and Marty Haught addressed what improvements have been made to RubyGems and shared interests for the future.

### Chaos Engineering on the Death Star

Sara Jackson calmly walked us through a chaotic environment. We were introduced to different tools and approaches to consider to harden and better understand our production systems at the application layer.

### Fast Forward: Speeding up Delegate Methods

Aaron Patterson skipped the jokes for more time to talk performance tuning. This time the focus was on delegating method arguments. The talk is a good demonstration or reminder of stack pointers, specifically presented in how it's relevant in this area.

### Closing Keynote

Nickolas Means presented a disastrous situation complicated by the reliance on automation and the level of abstraction that introduces.

## Day 2 - Hack Day and Workshops

### Who Wants to be a Ruby Engineer?

Drew Bragg brought his game show to the RubyConf main stage. This picture is blurry because it's impossible to get a clear one. Drew is never still on stage long enough.

### No Static Types? No Problem!

Noel Rappin delivered an even-handed summary of different type solutions available in Ruby. And included how we can achieve some of the benefits of types, or address some of the concerns that leads people to call for types, even in the absence of having them available to us.

## Day 3

### Opening Keynote

Brandon Weaver brought Fantasyland to RubyConf. We went down the rabbit hole for story hour.

### MVC Ruby in < 5k. The wonder of Camping

Karl Weber shared how the Camping web framework works. The knowledge and awareness of other frameworks, even if you aren't going to use it, is important. It shows a vibrant and growing ecosystem. It provides insights and options to inform the code you write, even if you're not working within the framework.

### 10 Years of Roda

Jeremy Evans followed to explore how Roda has changed from its first RubyConf presentation a decade ago.

### Closing Keynote

Nadia Odunayo walked us through another mystery in her private detective series. This ended with a dramatic twist that's not to be missed.
