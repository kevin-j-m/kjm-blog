Last week, I wrote a [post]({{< ref "/temporary-state-in-tests" >}}) on my
employer's [blog](https://blog.thegnar.co/temporary-state-in-tests) about using blocks in ruby to temporarily alter the state of
the application, and how that can be particularly helpful in tests.

That post was featured in Ruby Radar [#12](https://rubyradar.dev/issues/ruby-radar-12-back-to-our-regularly-scheduled-programming-726989).
