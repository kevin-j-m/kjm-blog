## Frequently Played

I tend to listen to the same songs or albums on repeat that are evocative of how I'm feeling or what's going on with me. Here is what I'm currently listening to over, and over, and over, and over, again.

## Halloween

'Tis the season.

[Full Lyrics](https://genius.com/The-gaslight-anthem-halloween-lyrics)

> Well I think I saw you for the flash of a moment  
> Your broken heart and the body that holds it  
> I lost your scent in the flash of the party  
> The big bright lights, baby, constantly haunt me  
> I've never been right, have you ever been lied to?  
> I think I just saw the same scars upon you  
> Is this a disguise? Or a masquerade for me?  

## Quiet

I've been listening to a lot of Siamese Dream.

> Behind me the grace of falling snow  
> Cover up everything you know  
> Come save me from the awful sound  
> Of nothing
