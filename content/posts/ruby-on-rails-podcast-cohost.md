## The Ruby on Rails Podcast

I co-hosted [episode 488](https://www.therubyonrailspodcast.com/488) of The Ruby on Rails Podcast. Brittany and I talked with Allison McMillan and Chelsea Kaufman about all the plans for RubyConf 2023.

All the thanks to Brittany Martin for asking me to join. I didn't have podcast hosting on my career bingo card.
