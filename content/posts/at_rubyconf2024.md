## RubyConf 2024

I'm starting this post from Terminal B in Logan Airport (Boston). Waiting for my plane, I figured I might put together a post to document a quick and loose exploration of what I see while I'm in Chicago.

## Travel

I had a surprisingly uneventful airport experience. Got there bright and early. Left and arrived without issue.

For anyone landing at Midway, look for the "Ground Transportation" signs, and eventually "CTA". The Orange Line Loop to Roosevelt will get you close to the conference hotel.

## Hotel

I'm staying at the conference hotel. I originally was going to stay elsewhere, but switched to the conference hotel for the convenience. I've got myself a fancy city view. It's only MOSTLY a view of HVAC systems from the next building (not pictured).

After checking in, I immediately saw Matz in the lobby with a group. I didn't say hi, but it confirmed I'm in the right place.
