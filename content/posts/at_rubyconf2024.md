## RubyConf 2024

I'm starting this post from Terminal B in Logan Airport (Boston). Waiting for my plane, I figured I might put together a post to document a quick and loose exploration of what I see while I'm in Chicago.

## Travel

I had a surprisingly uneventful airport experience. Got there bright and early. Left and arrived without issue.

For anyone landing at Midway, look for the "Ground Transportation" signs, and eventually "CTA". The Orange Line Loop to Roosevelt will get you close to the conference hotel.

## Hotel

I'm staying at the conference hotel. I've got myself a fancy city view. It's only MOSTLY a view of HVAC systems from the next building (not pictured).

After checking in, I immediately saw Matz in the lobby with a group. I didn't say hi, but it confirmed I'm in the right place.

## A Walk in the Park

The hotel is right by a series of parks, so I wandered around for a while on my own.

I stretched my legs.

I marveled at the existence of dedicated bike infrastructure.

Unlike at RailsConf in Detroit this year, I could not see Canada from across the water.

I still managed to make a splash.

It was a bit unseasonable to stay at the beach, so I just walked by.

I unexpectedly ran across some fairies.

Some of the walk was for the birds.

I scoped out a venue for my next speaking engagement.

Towards the end I realized I walked around the entire globe.

After I returned, it was time for early registration. I met some #RubyFriends and passed the afternoon with them.

It seems like Kitty O'Sheas is the conference bar of choice after hours. At least, it was tonight.

## Day 1

I went to Yolk for breakfast and had french toast. It was good! It's a few blocks straight down the street from the conference hotel.

I had already pre-registered, but I headed down to the ballroom area after eating to see how things were coming together.

I have this weird strategy at conferences: I go to the talks. Today I was in sessions with Matz, Murray Steele, Ahmed Omran, Noel Rappin, Brandt Sheets, Samuel Giddens, Martin Emde, Marty Haught, Sara Jackson, Aaron Patterson, and Nickolas Means.

Everyone did a great job. I'll have my recap post later. On to the random pictures of the day...

At lunch they served coconut creme brulee in these tiny mugs. It was tasty and unexpected.

Do you think the hotel has these rubies in this display case all the time, or just for us?

## Day 2

Breakfast with the Bragg family started the day...not to brag. And then it was off to the Keynote for the morning.

Hack day is always kind of a weird day for me. I'm glad that other people like it. I wandered for the rest of the morning, moving from conversation to conversation and actively not hacking.

I spent the afternoon in Noel Rappin's workshop, which was well-executed (of course).

After a quiet (appreciated) dinner, I spent some time at a thoughtbot event and talked to some #RubyFriends at game night before settling in for the evening.

No fun pictures today. Which doesn't mean no fun was had.

## Day 3

Last day, and an early start. I managed to fit in time for breakfast before Brandon's Keynote. I then watched talks from Karl Weber and Jeremy Evans before Nadia's Keynote.

I stopped by the reception to say some goodbyes. Then heading out with a small group to try an escape room. I can't say I was much help, but we did succeed. You're welcome everyone.

I met up with a group for dinner and then called it a night.

I'm ending RubyConf tired but thankful. I wish I saw more people. And had more time with the people I did see. But I'm so thankful for the work RubyCentral does year round to support our community. And the investment they make in bringing us together at events like this. Thank you #RubyFriends.
