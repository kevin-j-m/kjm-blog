## Frequently Played

I tend to listen to the same songs or albums on repeat that are evocative of how I'm feeling or what's going on with me. Here is what I'm currently listening to over, and over, and over, and over, again.

## The Blues, Mary

This song is a precursor, a warning, a premonition.

> I learned how to cry  
> In them lonesome September nights  
> I learned to get by  
> With the dogs and the dirt and the charm of the street  
> I fell asleep most nights  
> With your pictures right behind my eyes, your eyes  

## And All That Could Have Been

I started this series one year ago. I think it'd be a funny bit to just repeat
the same songs year after year. But this isn't a bit. I'm just in the same spot.

> Please  
> Take this  
> And run far away  
> Far as you can see  
> I am tainted  
> And happiness  
> And peace of mind  
> Were never meant for me  
> All these pieces  
> And promises  
> And left-behinds  
> If only I could see  
> In my nothing  
> You meant everything  
> Everything to me
