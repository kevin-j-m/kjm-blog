Last week, I wrote a [post]({{< ref "active-model-validations-csv" >}}) on my
employer's [blog](https://blog.thegnar.co/active-model-validations-csv) about
validating input from a CSV file using `ActiveModel::Validations`.

That post was featured in Ruby Weekly [#562](https://rubyweekly.com/issues/562).

It was also shared in Awesome Ruby [#270](https://ruby.libhunt.com/newsletter/270). This is the first time I've been in
Awesome Ruby!

All of my blog posts are cross-posted on [dev.to](https://dev.to/kevin_j_m),
and their ruby community was nice enough to share my post with their twitter
followers.

The tweet says:

Lastly, Ruby Radar [#9](https://rubyradar.dev/issues/ruby-radar-9-junior-spotlight-705164)
featured the post!
