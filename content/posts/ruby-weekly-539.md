I'm honored to be in this week's Ruby Weekly, [#539](https://rubyweekly.com/issues/539).

{{< figure src="/img/ruby_weekly_539.png" class="mid" >}} 

The article they included is a [post]({{< ref "using-sonic-pi-to-play-music-with-ruby" >}}) from my employer's [blog](https://blog.thegnar.co/using-sonic-pi-to-play-music-with-ruby) that was
part of my self-described "Software Design Concert Series". You can read it to
learn about how to trigger Sonic Pi from within your ruby code.
