I read a lot of Ruby news throughout the week. When someone asks me what they should follow, I first suggest that they not follow exactly the same blogs I do. Then I share the RSS feeds I follow just in case. But what I do suggest is starting with the following places. These highlight the work of others on a weekly basis. I then suggest they keep up with what resonates with them inside these round-ups.

## Sunday

As you get ready to start your work week, what's new out there that can get you excited to write some code? Check out the [Ruby Radar](https://www.rubyradar.com/) newsletter. The format shows two social media posts, two articles, two podcasts, two videos, and two code updates (commits, releases, projects).

## Monday

Waiting in your inbox as you start your week is the [Short Ruby Newsletter](https://newsletter.shortruby.com/). Naming is hard, and this is the most comprehensive round-up of information I follow. Lucian curates a highlighted list of information about our community, events, code and Ruby, gems and libraries, and related (not Ruby specific) updates.

If that's not enough for you, there's more. That's followed with a list of other newsletters, podcasts, videos, and articles of the week. You'll likely have a lot of tabs open after getting through a full edition of Short Ruby.

## Tuesday

After all that, you might need a break from reading. Instead, catch up with the newest episode of [The Bike Shed](https://www.bikeshed.fm/) podcast. While not Ruby-specific, the current hosts JoÃ«l Quenneville and Stephanie Minn frequently discuss Ruby topics. This thoughtbot podcast discusses what's new in these consultant's worlds from week to week.

## Wednesday

You can continue with a podcast today with a new episode of [The Ruby On Rails Podcast](https://www.therubyonrailspodcast.com/). It's hosted by Brittany Martin and a rotating panel of co-hosts. This is typically structured as an interview with a guest.

## Thursday

Thursday is a big day for Ruby news. The [Ruby Weekly](https://rubyweekly.com/) newsletter comes out on this day. On top of the hottest news and updates of the week, this highly-curated newsletter provides a sample of tutorials, articles, videos, code, and tools that updated throughout the week.

Later in the day, dig in to the [Awesome Ruby](https://ruby.libhunt.com/) newsletter with more popular news and articles, followed with trending projects.

There is also the [Ruby for All](https://www.rubyforall.com/) podcast. The topics can sometimes seem targeted to early-career developers. I've found that makes it an engaging conversation for everyone to follow and learn from.

## Friday

You can check out a summary of commits and PRs specific to Rails with the [This Week In Rails](https://world.hey.com/this.week.in.rails) newsletter.

Entertain yourself at the end of the week with the [Remote Ruby](https://remoteruby.com/) podcast. Andrew Mason, Chris Oliver, and Jason Charnes discuss the latest in what they're working on or interested in. Occasionally there are guests. Other times the panel of hosts are conversing amongst themselves.

## Saturday

Take a break if you need to. Or use the time to catch up on what you've missed from these places throughout the week.

## Weekly Reflection

After taking in the information, decide what sources from these curated experiences to keep up with. If you enjoyed what someone had to say, their latest won't always be in these round-ups. Follow podcast guests on social media. Add blogs you enjoy to your RSS reader. Join writer's newsletters. This is how I've cultivated my list of sources that I follow, whether they end up highlighted in a weekly review or not.
