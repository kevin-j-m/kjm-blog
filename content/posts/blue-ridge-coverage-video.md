## Blue Ridge Ruby Videos

I had a great time at [Blue Ridge Ruby]({{< ref "blue-ridge-ruby-2023-recap" >}}) last year. This was the first time I shared "[Enough Coverage To Beat the Band]({{< ref "coverage" >}})" with an in-person audience. The first stop on my "Ruby's Got You Covered" World Tour that didn't stream from the office in my house.

You can now view [all the talks](https://www.youtube.com/@BlueRidgeRuby/videos) from the conference on YouTube! That includes [mine](https://youtu.be/H4pBjWOMr_Y), which started off the events on day 1. Because I went first, they were still ironing out some kinks, like with the audio, but I hope you enjoy it nonetheless.
